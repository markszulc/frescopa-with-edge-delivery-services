## To create a site in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) using this template, follow these steps:
Navigate to the Sites Console:
Access your AEM authoring instance and go to the Sites console. 

### Initiate Site Creation:
In the Sites console, locate and click the "Create" button, typically found in the top-right corner. From the dropdown menu, select "Site from template."

### Import a Template:
* Go to <https://github.com/markszulc/frescopa-with-edge-delivery-services/releases> and download `frescopa-{version}.zip`
* Upload `frescopa-template-{version}.zip` in AEMaaCS's site creation wizard to create a new site from that template.

### Review Template Information:
After selecting a template, information about it will be displayed in the right column. Review this information to ensure it's the correct template.

### Proceed to Site Details:
Click "Next" to move to the next step of the wizard.

### Provide Site Details:
* Site Title: Enter 'Frescopa'
* Site Name: Enter 'frescopa'
* Git URL: Enter 'https://github.com/aem-showcase/frescopa' <-- Ideally fork this first and adjust to your copy. 

### Create the Site:
Click "Create." AEM will then create the site based on the selected template.

### Confirmation and Exploration:
A confirmation dialog will appear. Click "Done." The new site will now be visible in the Sites console, and you can navigate its basic structure as defined by the template.
